Code::Blocks build instructions:
--------------------------------
This section outlines the requirements and process to build Code::Blocks from source code.

Requirements:
    1) Optional: A recent Code::Blocks nightly build installed (http://www.codeblocks.org/nightly).
    2) A working GNU GCC C & C++ compiler.
    3) wxWidget and wxGTK3 development environment
    4) autotools environment (autoconf, automake, libtool, make, etc) and checkinstall
    5) GTK2 or GTK3 (preferred) development environment
    6) Boost development environment
    7) Hunspell development environment
    8) Gamin development environment
    9) Optional: SVN and/or GIT.
    10) Optional packages needed for building Debian deb files
    11) Optional package to resolve warnings when run from shell
    12) Other packages required
    
    DO NOT USE ANY SNAP PACKAGES as the installed packages are sandboxed by default.

    To install the items above the following are the commands to use for Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Linux Mint:
        # Step 2:
                sudo apt install -y wx3.0-headers wx-common libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-0v5 libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev libwxbase3.0-dev
        # Step 3:
                sudo apt install -y build-essential
        # Step 4:
                sudo apt install -y libtool automake autoconf checkinstall
        # Step 5:
                sudo apt install -y libgtk-3-dev
        # Step 6,7 & 8:
                sudo apt install -y libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libhunspell-dev libgamin-dev 
        # Optional step 9:
                sudo apt install -y subversion git
        # Optional step 10:
                sudo apt install -y libbz2-dev debhelper cdbs xsltproc fakeroot
        # Optional step 11:
                sudo apt install -y yaru-theme-icon
        # Step 12:
                sudo apt install -y discount libmarkdown2 libmarkdown2-dev

        ALL steps in one:
            apt install -y wx3.0-headers wx-common libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-0v5 libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev libwxbase3.0-dev build-essential libtool automake autoconf checkinstall libgtk-3-dev libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libhunspell-dev libgamin-dev  subversion git libbz2-dev debhelper cdbs xsltproc fakeroot yaru-theme-icon  discount libmarkdown2 libmarkdown2-dev

To build Code::Blocks:
    1) Grab the source code from https://sourceforge.net/p/codeblocks/code/HEAD/tree/ via SVN or via GIT or
        by downloading a snapshot.

    2) Make sure the source code directory does not have spaces or any non ASCII characters.

    3) In a terminal (e.g. bash) go to the top level folder you fetched the sources from SVN or GIT or the 
         directory you uncompressed the snapshot into.

    4) Instead of performing steps 6 through 8 you can run the following script:
        ./Build_Helper_Files/codeblocks_build.sh
       
        The codeblocks_build.sh script checks for errors and if something fails please look at the script to find which
          log file to check to see what failure occured so you can fix it.
        If the codeblocks_build.sh script passes then goto the last step

    5) Run the following to configure the project files for your environment:
        ./bootstrap

    6) Run the following to produce the makefile's for your environment so you can test it or debug before installing it 
        in the Linux OS directories:
            ./configure --with-contrib-plugins=all --prefix=$PWD/src/devel31

        or if you want to install the build in the Linux OS run the following:
        ./configure --with-contrib-plugins=all
        
        NOTE: This also only needs to be done once or if you make change to the build files used by the configure process.

        NOTES: 
            A) This also only needs to be done once or if you make change to the build files used by the configure process.
        
            B) To build C::B base files with no contributed plugins use --without-contrib-plugins instead of --with-contrib-plugins=all as per the following:
                ./configure --without-contrib-plugins

            D) To build C::B base files with all contributed plugins except help use the following:
                ./configure --with-contrib-plugins=all,-help

                Where:
                    "all" compiles all contrib plugins
                    "all,-help" compiles all contrib plugins except the help plugin
                    By default, no contrib plugins are compiled
                    Plugin names are (this list may be out of date, so you may need to lookup the plugin names manually) :
                            AutoVersioning, BrowseTracker, byogames, Cccc, CppCheck, cbkoders, codesnippets,
                            codestat, copystrings, Cscope, DoxyBlocks, dragscroll, EditorConfig, EditorTweaks, envvars, exporter,
                            FileManager, headerfixup, help, hexeditor, incsearch, keybinder, libfinder, MouseSap,
                            NassiShneiderman, ProjectOptionsManipulator, profiler, regex, ReopenEditor, rndgen, smartindent, spellchecker,
                            symtab, ThreadSearch, ToolsPlus, Valgrind, wxcontrib, wxsmith, wxsmithcontrib, wxsmithaui

    7) Run the following to build Code::Blocks
        make

        If you want to save the make results to a file then run the following command:
            make > make_result.txt 2>&1

    8) Run the following to copy all of the relevant files into the install directory structure:
        make install
       
       Notes: 
        a) depending on how you have configured the system you may need to run "make install" as root (sudo).
        b) If you want to save the make results to a file then run the following command:
            make > make_result.txt 2>&1

    9) If you run the ./codeblocks_build.sh of configured C::B with the "--prefix=$PWD/src/devel31" option then run the following to 
        test the C::B you built:
            cd $PWD/src/devel31/bin
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/src/devel31/bin
            ./codeblocks

Additional Notes/Info:
- - - - - - - - - - - -
1) To rebuild Code::Blocks run the following commands:
        make clean
        make

2) If the NassiShneiderman-plugin fails to build with a boost error then try the following:
    a) Check you have install the libboost-dev package by running the following command:
        dpkg -l | grep libboost | grep dev

    b) Explicitly set the boost-libdir by adding the following line to the configure-line above:
        "--with-boost-libdir=LIB_DIR"
       NOTE: Depending on your system, LIB_DIR might be "/usr/lib" or "/usr/lib64".

3) To clean the build and bootstrap files etc run the following command:
        ./Build_Helper_Files/codeblocks_cleanup.sh


Building WxWidgets
------------------
If for some reason you need to build wxWidgets here are the quick instructions:
    cd /home/<USERNAME>
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets wxWidgets_github
    cd /home/<USERNAME>/wxWidgets_github
    mkdir build-release-gtk3
    cd build-release-gtk3
    ../configure --disable-debug_flag --with-gtk=3
    make -j$(nproc)

If you want/need to install the files then run the following, but be aware this may cause issues if you 
have not build wxWidget correctly or built the version you need/want (USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION):
    sudo make install


Fetch Code::Blocks Source Code
------------------------------
In a command prompt, create or go to the folder you want the Code::Blocks SVN repository installed in 
and run the following command:
    svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/codeblocks/code/trunk codeblocks-code


NOTES:
1) If you use the svn command above on Windows and want to use the files on Linux then you will need to
    edit the appropriate file in the list  below for your SVN installation as follows:
        a) Remove the # comment at the beginning of the following option:
            enable-auto-props = yes
        b) Add the following line in the [auto-props] section:
            * = svn:eol-style=AS-IS
    Potential files:
        C:\msys64\home\<username>\.subversion\config
        C:\Users\<username>\.subversion\config
        C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Subversion\config
2) I do not recommend the following as you may encounter issues with EOL if you transfer the files to Linux or if you 
    compare against the SF soruce snapshot as the SVN keywords are not expanded:
       git svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codeblocks/code/trunk codeblocks-code
    
3) I also do NOT recommend using TortoiseSVN on Windows to do the initial checkout as you may encounter issues with 
     EOL if you transfer the files to Linux
