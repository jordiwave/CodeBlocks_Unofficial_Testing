# CODE::BLOCKS  GDB/MI DEBUGGER PLUGIN

## Description

This GitHub repo contains the source code for a Code::Blocks GDB/MI debugger plugin. The debugger is able to debug itself and is a viable replacement for the existing GDB plugin.


## Updates / Testing Results / Dev Work

If you need help with using the plugin then wait for it to be production ready.

Please use the discussion for any test results that pass and are shown as working in the table.

Please create a new issue (if it does not allready exist) for any test in the table below that fail and are shown as working in the table.

If you fix any outstanding issue please fork this repo and create a pull request.


## OUTSTANDING ITEMS

### High Priority

These are banked up waiting for the next nightly to be released:
1. Build plugin using the SVN trunk source.
2. Test plugin against SVN trunk C::B build.
3. Fix bug reports....
4. Test: https://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,25065.new.html#new


### Medium Priority

1. Create patch for C::B source and submit - zip directory or include a link to github repo.
2. When time permits re-test all items!!!! 

### Low Priority / Future Work

  * Persist debug data between sessions:
     Outstanding:
        - watch data                            - save/load working
        - watch data edited                     - not done
        - memory dump (single memory dialog)    - not done
        - memory view (multiple memory dialog)  - not done
        - data break point                      - not done

     Save/load working:
        - line break points                 - save/load working
        - count line break point            - save/load working
        - conditional line break point      - save/load working
  * Expand function argument and local variables in the watch window.
  * Add ability delete data watch point https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb/html_node/gdb_31.html
  * Remote debugging 
       - use Project->Properties->"Debugger GDB/MI" tab data.
  * Create Linux project file
  * Create MacOS project file
  * Update Linux makefile build process
  * Update MSYS2 makefile build process
  * Update MacOS makefile build process
  * CPU registry dialog modify to fix value column to say 50 characters.
  * More (easy) integration of pretty printing
  * Add function break point support. See "#warning" messages.

  * Checkpoints (only available on linux )
  * Display the return value of a function after "step out"
  * Skipping functions - see https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Skipping-Over-Functions-and-Files.html
  * Record replay (only linux)
