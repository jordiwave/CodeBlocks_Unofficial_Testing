## Description

The C::B DAP debugger is able to do simple debugging on **MacOS** & Windows & Linux.


## Updates / Testing Results / Dev Work

The DAP debugger plugin does not include all of the features the existing GDB annotations debugger has, but it does work on the MacOS.

If you find issue that is listed in the table below that indicates it is passing then please raise an issue.


## OUTSTANDING ITEMS

### High Priority

1. Update table below for outstanding issues/items

### Medium Priority

Move lines needs cbplugin.cpp and cbplugin.cpp change to add ShiftAllFileBreakpoints(...) function
Pass(2) - Needs updated 1229 files to build.
n/a/? - can change, but default works and should not be changed.
Pass(3) - Enabled even if disabled
